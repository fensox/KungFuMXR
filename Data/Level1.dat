# Kung Fu MXR - Standard Level Metadata File
#
# File format description:
#
# 1) Lines beginning with # are comments. Blank lines along with leading and trailing whitespace is attempted to be ignored.
#
# 2) This metadata file contains key/value pairs of information on game levels. The available settins for the game are:
#
#	NAME=level name			- The name of the level.
#
#	BACKGROUND=./filename		- This is the path and filename (game executable relative) of the level background graphic.
#					- Only include one of these per metafile.
#
#	MUSIC=./filename		- Background music to play on a loop during this level. File path rules same as for background.
#					- Only include one of these per metafile.
#
#	PLAYER_START=900, 400		- The starting coordinates for the player on this level given as X, Y coordinates to
#					  the BOTTOM-RIGHT of the player image. We don't always know the height of the player
#					  and many times wish them to start on solid ground.
#
#	COLRECT=0, 1200, 1000, 80	- Collision rectangles in the level. Include as many of these lines as needed per level.
#					  Rectangles are specified as: Top Left X position, Top Left Y position, Width, Height
#
# 3) Note all level design is based on a 720 pixel tall background resolution with a 1280 pixel wide scrolling viewport.
#    Larger/smaller game windows scale this up or down to fit.
