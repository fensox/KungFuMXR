# Kung Fu MXR - Standard Level Metadata File V.1.0
#
# File format description:
#
# 1) Lines beginning with # are comments. Blank lines along with leading and trailing whitespace is attempted to be ignored.
#
# 2) This metadata file contains key/value pairs of information on game levels. The available settins for the game are:
#
#	NAME=level name			- The name of the level.
#
#	BACKGROUND=path and file	- This is the path and filename (game executable relative) of the level background graphic.
#					- Only include one of these per metafile.
#
#	TRANS_COLOR=r,g,b,a		- A transparency color to use on the background texture. Values from 0-255. The "a" (fourth)
#					  value is not used as an alpha as might be thought. It is used to turn on/off if we are
#					  using transparency at all. A value of 0 means transparency is off. Any value other
#					  than 0 turns on transparency and used the RGB values given.
#
#	MUSIC=path and file		- Background music to play on a loop during this level. File path rules same as for background.
#					- Only include one of these per metafile.
#
#	PLAYER_START=x, y		- The starting integer coordinates for the player on this level given as X, Y coordinates
#					  to center of player.
#
#	COLRECT=x, y, w, h		- Collision rectangles in the level. Include as many of these lines as needed per level.
#					  Rectangles are specified as integers: Top Left X position, Top Left Y position, Width, Height
#					  Important Note: If the collision rectangle height is shorter than the difference in animation
#					  frame heights then a sprite could get caught in the floor. Keep heights as tall as possible.
#
# 3) Note all level design is based on a 720 pixel tall background resolution with a 1280 pixel wide scrolling viewport.
#    Larger/smaller game windows scale this up or down to fit.
#
