Kung Fu MXR (Mr. X's Revenge)
-----------------------------
v.1.0 Summer 2020
Designed and Coded by Fensox

Premise
-------
2D sidescrolling game sequel to the NES (and arcade) classic Kung Fu. This time the player takes control of Mr. X the villain from the original game who has a change of heart and goes back into his gang's lair and takes them out.

Execution
---------
Written in c++ using SDL 2 and some additional SDL libraries for sound and image loading. Brand new engine from the ground up mimicking the original Kung Fu but adding some new features to keep things interesting for the player. Keyboard, controller, and touch screen support planned.
